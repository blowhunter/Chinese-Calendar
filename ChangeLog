July 25, 2008, changes from 2.4 to 2.5:
* Adopted formulae published by NASA in computing delta T for improved
  accuracy.
* Updated parameters for moon phase computation from 2005 printing of
  second edition of Astronomical Algorithms by Meeus.
* Added corrections based on results from DE405 for a few cases for
  years between 1645 and 2200.

January 6, 2008:
* Rereleased 2.4 to distribute portions of ccal related to computing
  Chinese dates under LGPL.
March 26, 2006, changes from 2.3.3 to 2.4:
* Added XML mode.
* Added ccalhtm.xsl sample.
July 6, 2004, changes from 2.3.2 to 2.3.3: 
* Corrected a bug in ASCII mode that causes large number of blanks being
  printed if the month title is wider than the calendar body.
June 19, 2004, changes from 2.3.1 to 2.3.2: 
* Added Chinese output in title for HTML output for use in Chinese web pages. 
* Added ccalpdf shell script to create PDF calendar using ghostscript which
  must have been installed to function. Its manual page is also added. It
  works on UNIX and cygwin on Windows. 
October 20, 2003, changes from 2.3 to 2.3.1:
* Corrected a bug in PostScript mode that caused incorrect format for
  a yearly calendar when a jieqi and new lunar month day fall on the
  same day. Both yearly and monthly calendar should show correct
  behavior now.
October 4, 2003, changes from 2.2 to 2.3:
* For any calendar month with new lunar month(s) starting in it, added
  starting date(s) of lunar month(s) to month header to reduce confusion
  on to which lunar month a day belongs. 
* Added UTF-8 support for outputing either traditional or simplified
  Chinese characters in character or HTML modes.
* In character mode, if output is in either traditional or simplified
  Chinese, the names of days of week were changed from full English
  words to 3-letter abbreviations and Chinese names like in HTML or EPS
  modes.
* Corrected a bug in PostScript mode that caused incorrect format for
  a monthly calendar when a jieqi and new lunar month day fall on the
  same day.
January 29, 2003, changes from 2.1.1 to 2.2:
* Released under the GNU Public License.
* Added logic to remove unused or duplicated character definitions in
  EPS output which reduced the size of EPS output for monthly calendar
  by around 15%. 
* Incorporated latest updates in NOVAS-C package.
July 20, 2002, changes from 2.1 to 2.1.1:
* Modified format string in a printf statement to work around accidental 
  triggering of an undesired feature that affects Windows executable
  causing the EPS output to malfunction for yearly calendar or for the
  month of March.
* Replaced one Chinese character with a better looking alternative.
June 20, 2002, changes from 2.0 to 2.1:
* Added outputs of either traditional or simplified Chinese characters
  in character mode in addition to the existing ASCII output.
* Enhanced the ASCII output to show whether a lunar month is a long
  month or a short month.
March 24, 2002, changes from 1.2.2 to 2.0:
* Added support for traditional Chinese characters for both EPS mode
  and HTML table mode.
* For EPS mode, vector Chinese font is used in place of bitmap font.
  This will enable the resulting EPS calendar to be arbitrarily scaled.
* Newer style DSC is used in EPS output.
* Corrected mode in man page install in Makefile.
August 24, 2001, changes from 1.2.1 to 1.2.2:
* Should a new lunar month and a solarterm fall on the same day, they
  are now marked together except in character mode in which the marking
  of new lunar month is moved to the next day.
* To mitigate the confusion on which lunar month it is for a lunar date
  since the heading always refer to the lunar month(s) to start
  which is not always noted by a reader, marking of lunar month is added
  to the 1st of each calendar month except in character mode or in yearly
  EPS mode.
* For EPS mode, changed font for date numbers from Times/Courier to 
  Bookman which scales better with the Chinese characters underneath.
December 10, 2000, changes from 1.2 to 1.2.1:
* Corrected a bug in determining the first lunar date of the year. The
  bug will cause the lunar dates for January to be one less until the new
  lunar month for a few years.
* Added check to make sure the new moon times returned is within the
  specified period. Previously it may go slightly out of the bound.
August 24, 2000, changes from 1.1 to 1.2:
* For Encapsulated PostScript output, the resources are reorganized to include
  only those necessary for the current file. This significantly reduced the
  size of a monthly calendar.
* Separated version report into a header file. Also version information is
  displayed with usage information. 
April 1, 2000, changes from 1.0 to 1.1:
* Substituted high resolution Chinese font for monthly calendar to eliminate
  the jagged look. The new fonts look reasonably smooth even when the calendar
  is enlarged to occupy a full page.
* A cache of years from 1950 to 2050 is added to improve the performance on
  slower computers for those years.
* In Encapsulated PostScript output, font selection was changed to use late
  binding rather than early binding since some versions of the Microsoft
  PostScript driver fails to embed the picture correctly with early binding.
* In Encapsulated PostScript output, a redundant font comment is removed.

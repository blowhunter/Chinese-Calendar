The ccal utility writes a Gregorian calendar together with Chinese calendar
to standard output. Its usage is similar to the cal program generally
available on unix platforms. In addition to ASCII output, it can also
generate Encapsulated PostScript, HTML table and XML outputs for use in
do-it-yourself calendars and web pages. It supports both simplified
and traditional Chinese characters.

The latest version of this utility and its web interface, which offers
more functionality including automated creation of a customized calendar
with a picture of your choice, can be found at the following web site:

Build and Install:
To build, just type
	make
To install the program and man page in /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/man, use
	make install
	make install-man

It is recommended to use the gnu make and recent g++ to build the program. 
User customization of the Makefile may be necessary for other compilers
and versions of the make utility.

All is not lost if your 'make' command refuses to work with the
Makefile. You can still compile manually if your C++ compiler does
support the Standard Template Library. Just cd into the source directory
and try
	CC -O -DUSE_YEARCACHE -o ccal *.cpp
Substitue CC with the C++ compiler command as appropriate. You will need
to add the option -DNO_NAMESPACE if your compiler doesn't handle
namespace properly.

Refer to the man page for usage.
